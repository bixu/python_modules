## About This Repository
This repository is an effort to automatically re-package certain very large and/or complex Python modules as Habitat packages, with an eye towards speeding up operations like `pip install` for Habitat-packaged Python apps that have very large dependencies. Built packages can be found under the `pip` [origin](https://bldr.habitat.sh/#/origins/pip) of the public Habitat Builder service.

## Corporate Sponsorship
This work would not have been possible without support from [smartB, GmbH](https://www.smartb.eu).
